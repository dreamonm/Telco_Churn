# Telco Churn Prediction Project

This project aims to identify the factors contributing to customer churn in a fictional California-based telecommunications company. By analyzing a comprehensive dataset of 7,043 customer records from Q3, we seek to create predictive models that forecast customer behavior and predict which customers are at risk of churning.

# Dataset Overview:
The dataset consists of five datasets containing information about demographics, location, population, services, and status of the Telco customers. It includes a wide range of features, such as customer demographics, service usage patterns, and geographic information.
